# Python_Weather_App
A school project to create a weather prediction app using python, the open_meteo api, sqlite, and the sqlalchemy library. The goal of the project was to choose a date in the future where an event will take place. For this project, I chose the upcoming US 2025 presidential inauguration. See README for more details.
